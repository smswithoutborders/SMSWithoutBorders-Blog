Keeping your online account credentials safe is a tricky balance between convenience and privacy. To give you more control, we’ve rolled out a new feature that lets you store your access tokens (the digital keys to your online platforms) right on your phone, not on our cloud servers.

Storing your tokens locally means reducing your reliance on our servers and minimizing the risk of your sensitive account information being exposed or compromised. This is especially valuable for users who live or work in places with limited or unreliable internet access, or for anyone who values privacy and control over their own data.
Here’s how it works: when you turn this feature on, any access tokens currently stored in the cloud are securely transferred to your device. From that moment, new tokens will be saved only on your device and never sent back to the cloud. If you decide to turn the feature off later, new tokens will once again be stored on our servers, but the ones already on your phone remain safe and encrypted.

Due to the platform’s security policies, when Twitter tokens are stored locally, you can only send one message before you need to revoke and restore the token to send another. While this requires a bit more effort, it adds an extra layer of security for your Twitter account and aligns with best practices for handling sensitive credentials.

This new feature reflects our ongoing commitment to strengthening privacy and security without sacrificing functionality. We want to empower you with tools that keep your communications private and your data in your hands.
Update your SMSWithoutBorders app and find the new option for store tokens on device in your settings and let us know what you think of this new feature.
