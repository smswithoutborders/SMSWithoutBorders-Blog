Before now RelaySMS required online setup processes, including account creation and saving platforms. RelaySMS Bridges breaks these barriers. With Bridges, you can start using the app immediately, without needing to sign up, log in, or save platform credentials. This eliminates the need for an internet connection during critical situations when immediate communication is indispensable.

### How it Works

When the user chooses to use bridges they receive a one-time code and a special phrase via SMS to verify their identity and encrypt their messages. Bridges uses the phone number to create a temporary alias (e.g.,[123456789@relaysms.me](123456789@relaysms.me)) which will be used to send messages.

RelaySMS Bridges prioritize security. The one-time code verifies your number, and the special phrase creates an encrypted connection for your messages. Users are required to paste the entire authentication message to ensure the process is completed successfully.

Once verified, you can now send messages to your preferred online platforms, without the need for internet. This functionality empowers individuals, organizations, and communities to stay connected and informed, regardless of their internet access. Whether facing internet outages, censorship attempts, or simply needing reliable communication in remote regions, Bridges ensures your voice remains heard.
