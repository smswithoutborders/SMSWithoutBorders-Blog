At SMSWithoutBorders, we're constantly working to improve how users stay connected even without internet access. With that goal in mind, we’re excited to introduce two amazing new features for RelaySMS: **Replies for Bridges and Message Delivery Status.**

## 📩 Replies for Bridges: Receive Responses Even Offline

One of the greatest challenges of offline communication is knowing if the recipient has responded. We introduced **[the Bridges feature](https://blog.smswithoutborders.com/posts/Bridges)** in a previous update, which enables users to communicate without saving their accounts, but are given primary aliases which act as their default RelaySMS accounts. The new feature, **Replies for Bridges**, enables users who send messages through **Bridges** to now receive replies directly via SMS.

### Here’s how it works:

- When you send a message from your RelaySMS account (using a Bridge), the recipient can reply; currently emailing is the only form of Bridge communication available.
- The reply will arrive as an **encrypted SMS** in your phone’s default messaging app.
- To read the reply, simply **copy the message**, go to the **Inbox** section of the RelaySMS app, and paste it into the decryption box.
- Tap **"Decrypt"**, and your message will be readable inside the app.

> **Important to Note:** This feature only works for messages sent using **Bridges**. Messages sent via stored platforms (like Telegram, Twitter, or Gmail) will not receive SMS replies. Also included in this update, the users can send messages without the need to go through the authentication process required in the previous release.

## 📬 Message Delivery Status: Know If Your Message Was Sent

We understand how crucial it is to know if your message was successfully sent, and RelaySMS users are usually in the dark about the status of their messages to be published with online platforms. The new **Message Delivery Status** feature now enables users to now receive an **SMS notification** for every message sent through RelaySMS using their stored platforms.

- 📩 If your message is successfully published to the intended platform, you will get a **confirmation SMS**.
- ❌ If the message **fails**, you will be notified so you can take action.

> **Important to Note:** The delivery report status is not encrypted and does not contain any sensitive information. This feature works only for publishing with saved platforms.

With these updates, **RelaySMS continues ensuring users can send and receive messages even during internet shutdowns.** Stay connected, no matter what.
