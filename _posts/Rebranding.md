SMSWithoutBorders is undergoing a transformation to better reflect the expanding capabilities of our project. While the core mission of secure and accessible messaging remains, we're streamlining our branding with a new name for the user-facing app and a broader project identity.


### Introducing RelaySMS!

The SMSWithoutBorders(swob) app you know and love is getting a new name: RelaySMS. This name reflects the app's core function â€“ acting as a secure relay for your offline messages. With RelaySMS, you can seamlessly connect your favorite messaging platforms and send messages without an internet connection. Also, SWOB was really not a great name for an app.


### SMSWithoutBorders: The Project

SMSWithoutBorders now becomes the umbrella project name, encompassing the development and ongoing evolution of both RelaySMS and DekuSMS, the open-source end-to-end encrypted messaging Android app. We believe this distinction clarifies the project's scope while giving each app its own distinct identity.


### Why the Change?

Our mission remains the same: to empower users with secure and accessible communication, regardless of connectivity. However, as our project grows, we want to ensure clarity and future-proof our branding. This new structure allows us to explore additional functionalities and messaging tools under the SMSWithoutBorders project name, while RelaySMS continues to deliver the exceptional offline-to-online messaging experience you've come to expect.

### What Does This Mean for You?

The core functionality of the app isn't changing! You will be getting the same, offline to online messaging capabilities, and seamless integration with your favorite messaging platforms with an increased level of security with the introduction of the RelaySMS vault feature which adds an additional layer of protection to your access tokens. Over the coming weeks, you'll see the updated branding reflected in the app store and our website
We're thrilled to embark on this new chapter with you. Stay tuned for exciting updates and developments within the SMSwithoutBorders project! Visit our [website]() for more information on the rebrand and updates.
