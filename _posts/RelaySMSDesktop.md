We’re excited to announce the launch of the RelaySMS Desktop Application, a standalone app designed to bring offline to online messaging to your desktop. Whether you’re in a remote area or trying to stay connected in an internet shutdown, RelaySMS Desktop enables you to send messages without the need for an internet connection or your mobile device.

RelaySMS Desktop offers the same messaging experience as the mobile apps, now optimized for desktop devices that support SIM cards and run on Linux operating systems. Desktop devices that don’t support SIM cards can send messages with the app using a modem. This is great for those who prefer working from their desktop but need the flexibility to stay connected, even without internet access.

RelaySMS Desktop mirrors the functionality of the mobile app, ensuring that you don’t miss out on any features. Highlights include:

- **Offline to Online Messaging**: Send messages to your preferred online platform without the need for internet connection.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Your messages remain private and secure, giving you peace of mind.
- **Bridge and Platform Options**: Choose to save platforms for quick access or use bridges for temporary connections without saving.

## For New Users

If you’ve never used RelaySMS, now is the perfect time to start. Simply download the app to your Linux desktop device, set it up, and begin sending messages without an internet connection.

## For Existing Users

If you’re already using the RelaySMS mobile app, you’ll love how easy it is to transition to the desktop application. Log in to your existing account, and all your saved platforms will be ready for use, exactly as you left them.
