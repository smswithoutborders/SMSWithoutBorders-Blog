## Putting Your Access Tokens Where They Belong: On Your Device

Keeping your online account credentials safe is a tricky balance between convenience and privacy. To give you more control, we’ve rolled out a new feature that lets you store your access tokens (the digital keys to your online platforms) right on your phone, not on the RelaySMS servers.

Storing your tokens locally means reducing your reliance on our servers and giving you total control of your stored tokens.
This is especially valuable for users who value privacy and control over their data.

**Here’s how it works:** when you turn this feature on, any access tokens currently stored on the RelaySMS server are securely transferred to your device.

From that moment, new tokens will be saved only on your device. If you decide to turn the feature off later, new tokens will once again be stored on our servers, but the ones already on your phone remain safe and encrypted.

Due to the platform’s security policies, when Twitter tokens are stored locally, you can only send one message before you need to revoke and restore the token to send another.

Therefore, refreshed Twitter tokens will be sent via sms to the user after every successfully sent Twitter message, and the users will need to paste said tokens into the app to be able to send new tweets without the need for revoking and restoring. While this requires a bit more effort, it adds an extra layer of security for your Twitter account and aligns with best practices for handling sensitive credentials.

This new feature reflects our ongoing commitment to strengthening privacy and security without sacrificing functionality. We want to empower you with tools that keep your communications private and your data in your hands.

[Update](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afkanerd.sw0b) your SMSWithoutBorders app and find the new option for **‘store tokens on device’** in your settings, and let us know what you think of this new feature.
