At RelaySMS (formerly SMSWithoutBorders(SWOB) app), we understand the importance of staying connected, even when you're offline. But we also value your privacy and the flexibility to manage your communication needs. That's why we're excited to announce a new feature that puts you in control: Device ID Registration with RelaySMS Vault!



### What is Device ID Registration?

Previously, RelaySMS relied primarily on phone numbers for user identification. This meant that switching phone numbers, traveling, or using multiple devices could potentially disrupt your ability to send offline messages.
With Device ID Registration, made possible by the innovative RelaySMS Vault, we're changing that system. Now, you can choose to register your RelaySMS account using your device's unique ID instead of just your phone number. This allows your access tokens (think of them as digital keys for sending offline messages) to be linked to your device, not just your phone number.



### Why is Device ID Registration a Big Deal?

Here's what Device ID Registration brings to the table:
Unmatched Flexibility: Switching phone numbers, or using a temporary SIM card while traveling â€“ no worries! Device ID Registration ensures your access to offline messaging remains uninterrupted.
Enhanced Privacy: We prioritize your privacy. Using your device ID for registration provides an additional layer of anonymity, reducing reliance on your phone number.
Enhanced Security: The Vault adds an extra layer of encryption for your access tokens, keeping them safe from unauthorized access.


### Maintaining Control: The Choice is Yours

While Device ID Registration offers a convenient and secure option, we understand that some users might prefer phone number-based identification. Rest assured, the choice is yours! You can still choose to link your RelaySMS account to a specific phone number if that works best for you.
Device ID Registration, combined with the power of RelaySMS Vault, offers a new level of flexibility and privacy for your offline messaging experience. Read the [vault release note](link) for more information on the vault.
