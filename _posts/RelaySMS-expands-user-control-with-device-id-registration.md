At SMSwithoutBorders, we're constantly striving to enhance your secure messaging experience. To accomplish this, we rely on data to comprehend how users interact with our tools. Here's where the SMSwithoutBorders Telemetry Dashboard comes in!
This dashboard is our central hub for visualizing key user metrics, providing valuable insights into usage and user base growth. Let's delve into the first three core metrics displayed on the dashboard: Sign-Ups, Available Users, and Countries.

### Sign-Ups: Tracking Our Growing Community.

The Sign-Ups metric acts as a vital growth indicator. It simply counts the total number of users who have created accounts on the SMSWOB app. This metric helps us understand the app's overall reach and user acquisition effectiveness.
A steady increase in sign-ups indicates a growing interest in our secure offline-to-online messaging solution. To see how many users have signed up on the [telemetry page](https://staging.smswithoutborders.com:8080/), just click 'Signed Up Users' and filter by date and year to get the specific timeframe you're interested in.

### Available Users: Staying Connected with Active Accounts

The “Available Users” metric takes things a step further. It focuses on the number of users who have active accounts within the app. This provides valuable insights into user retention and engagement.
A healthy “Available Users” number suggests that users are finding value in the SMSWOB app and keeping their accounts active. By monitoring this metric over time, we can identify potential areas for improvement that might encourage continued user engagement. The 'Available Users' section on the [telemetry page](https://staging.smswithoutborders.com:8080/) displays this data. You can conveniently filter the results by date and year for a more granular view.

### Country Breakdown: A Global Reach

The country metric paints a fascinating picture of our user base's geographical distribution. It displays not only the specific countries where users are signing up but also the total number of countries where the SMSWOB app is being utilized to stay connected. This data allows us to see how our secure offline-to-online messaging solution is breaking down barriers and fostering communication across the globe despite varying internet connectivity statuses. To explore user trends by country, click on 'available Users' on the [telemetry page](https://staging.smswithoutborders.com:8080/). You can then filter the data by date and year to see how users vary across different countries.
